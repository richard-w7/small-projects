### Monty Hall
Simulating the Monty Hall problem and the statistics of each door
  
---
### Substitution cipher
Generate random cipher text from plaintext with key  
Decrypt cipher text using frequency analysis (automatically, manually or with provided key)
  
---
### MCMC
A look into how MCMC methods work  
  
---
### Function Optimiser
A study into how different methods optimise for y minima with different piecewise functions  
Enter functions as: func1, n<=x<m   - Seperate functions with '|', function ranges cannot overlap  
  
---
### Ray Casting
Learning how ray casting works with object collision. The yellow cone is the player's view, control the player with 'wasd' for movement, left and right arrows for turning.

### Gravity Simulation
Simulating gravity around a planet, specifically spacecraft orbiting the planet. First click to initialise the starting position of the spacecraft, second click sets the velocity. Spacecrafts that are in stable orbit are tracked and turned green.
